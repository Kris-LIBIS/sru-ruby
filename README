DESCRIPTION

sru is a Ruby library for talking to servers that support the Search & Retrieve
by URL (SRU) protocol. SRU is essentially a lightweight api for performing
information retrieval over HTTP. <http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/>

Typically SRU clients perform a 'searchRetrieve' operation on a 
repository and get back different flavored XML metadata for the hits. In
addition SRU clients can perform an 'explain' operation which asks the SRU
server to describe itself, and its capabilities. The final operation is 'scan'
which allows a client to walk an index of terms used in the target.

USAGE

  require 'sru'

  # create the client using a base address for the SRU service
  client = SRU::Client.new 'http://sru.example.com'

  # fetch a SRU::ExplainResponse object from the server
  explain = client.explain

  # issue a search and get back a SRU::SearchRetrieveResponse object 
  # which serves as an iterator 
  records = client.search_retrieve 'rosetta stone', {:maximumRecords => 5}
  for record in records
    puts records
  end

  # issue a scan request
  for term in client.scan('king tut') 
    puts term
  end
